# Modular Neuromorphic Analogue Neural Net

![Synapse Test](https://github.com/RepRapLtd/AnalogueNeuralNet/blob/main/Pix/synapse-breadboard.jpg)

This is a project to create a neuromorphic analoge neural network. It will be modular, and so can be used to make networks of (within limits yet to be explored) any size.

The basic idea is to use crosspoint analoge switches to make all the interconnections in a way that is completely programmable.

So. How will it work?
